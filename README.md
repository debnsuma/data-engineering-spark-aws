# Data Engineering with Apache Spark on AWS

This course will provide a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of Apache Spark, a powerful and widely-used big data processing framework. Students will learn about Spark's architecture, RDDS, DataFrames, Spark Core, and Spark SQL. It will also cover few of the Spark Internals and performance optimization. The course will cover how to use Spark to process and analyze large datasets, including distributed data processing and machine learning. Students will also learn about Spark's ecosystem, including popular libraries and tools for data processing and visualization. The course will feature hands-on lab exercises that will enable students to apply their knowledge and build real-world Spark applications. 

This course will also cover the fundamentals of data engineering using Apache Spark with PySpark on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Students will learn how to process and analyze large datasets efficiently using Spark and Python, as well as how to deploy a Spark application on AWS using different services like Amazon EMR, and AWS Glue. It will also cover few of the other integration like, Apache Spark with other services like Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift. 

By the end of this course, students will have a solid understanding of data engineering with Apache Spark and will be able to build scalable and robust data pipelines on AWS.
